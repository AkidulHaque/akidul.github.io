        In this paper, we explore the Leslieâ€“Gower type preyâ€“predator model with a Holling-IV functional response, 
        examining both deterministic and stochastic environments. 
        Our analysis highlights the emergence of complex bifurcation patterns and 
        stochastic extinction probabilities under varying environmental fluctuations.

      <p class="desc">
        This study presents a modified predator-prey model incorporating key ecological factors: logistic
        growth of the prey population, Holling type II functional response for predation, and an Allee effect
        in the predator population and competition among the predators. This research contributes to ecological
        modeling by integrating deterministic and stochastic perspectives, providing insights for biodiversity
        conservation and ecosystem management.

        This study integrates behavioural, psychological, and microbiome perspectives to investigate HIV PrEP adherence 
        among African American adults in the U.S. South. Using mixed-methods analysis, the work highlights how 
        psychosocial stressors and microbial dysbiosis jointly impact adherence outcomes and intervention design.

        This work investigates the anti-controlled Lorenz system (Chen system), focusing on the role of control parameters in inducing 
        or suppressing chaotic dynamics. Analytical and numerical methods are applied to reveal stability boundaries, 
        bifurcation structures, and potential engineering applications of controlled chaos.

      <p class="desc">
       We are working on a Spatiotemporal Dynamic Lag
models to newcast Covid-19 rates using wastewater data of different counties across New York state.
This study incorporates a geographically weighted process to consider the heterogeneity of disease
transmission and under-reporting in relation to wastewater virus concentration, the temporal lags
to address virus incubation periods and reporting delays, and the spatial correlations across counties
to enhance the prediction accuracy and early warning system.

  <p class="desc">
    This ongoing study develops an ARCH-based modeling framework to examine the relationship between 
    SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater and underreported COVID-19 cases. The work captures temporal 
    volatility in case reporting, addresses under-ascertainment in surveillance data, and evaluates the 
    predictive power of wastewater signals for enhancing outbreak monitoring and public health decision-making.

  <em>"Mathematical analysis of controlling invasive species in competition with native species."</em>
  <p class="desc">
   In this paper, we aim to mathematically analyze the dynamics of invasive 
species competing with native species.
    The analysis explores interspecific interactions, equilibrium states, and stability conditions, 
    with a focus on identifying threshold parameters that determine invasion success or extinction. The overarching 
    aim is to propose effective mathematical strategies to mitigate invasive species spread while ensuring the 
    persistence of native populations.
