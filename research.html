     This study develops a predator–prey model that incorporates logistic growth of the prey population, 
    a Holling type II functional response, and both an Allee effect and intraspecific competition in the predator population.
    The nonlinear interactions between species are first examined using a deterministic framework.
    To better capture real ecological conditions, a stochastic component is then introduced to account for
    environmental variability and random fluctuations affecting population interactions.
    A comparative analysis of the deterministic and stochastic models is carried out to investigate
    the influence of ecological and environmental factors on population dynamics,
    with particular emphasis on stability, persistence, and extinction. Equilibrium points are
    analyzed to identify conditions that promote species coexistence or lead to population decline.
    The stochastic model further enhances understanding of predator–prey dynamics by revealing system 
    vulnerability and resilience under environmental uncertainty. 
    Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the theoretical results and to demonstrate the applicability
    of the model to real-world ecological systems. By integrating deterministic and stochastic perspectives, 
    this study contributes to ecological modeling and provides insights relevant to ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. .

    Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains one of the most effective strategies for preventing HIV infection, yet its success
depends on sustained adherence. Evidence increasingly shows that adherence lapses are not purely behavioral but stem from
interacting biological, psychological, and social factors. This review aimed to synthesize existing evidence on how hazardous
alcohol use, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and gut microbiome dysbiosis interact as syndemic determinants of PrEP
adherence, using the Socioecological Model (SEM) to interpret multilevel influences.

    This umbrella review synthesizes evidence on how alcohol use disrupts adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) 
    and increases susceptibility to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. The study examines diverse behavioral, 
    clinical, and socio-structural factors influencing PrEP continuity and highlights intervention opportunities for 
    improving prevention outcomes among at-risk populations.

    This study develops and analyzes a compartmental co-infection model capturing the complex interaction 
    dynamics between Dengue and Chikungunya viruses. By incorporating dual-infection pathways, vector–host 
    transmission, and epidemiological parameters, the model explores threshold conditions, equilibrium behavior, 
    and long-term disease persistence. The work provides valuable insights for public health planning, informing 
    intervention strategies in regions where both arboviruses co-circulate.
